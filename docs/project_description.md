# GenAI-Powered Data Insights Platform

## Client Overview

As the **Director of Sales & Operations** at a rapidly growing retail company with both online and physical outlets, I need to make fast, data-driven decisions to respond to shifting consumer behavior, inventory fluctuations, and marketing opportunities. However, my team struggles with timely access to actionable insights due to the following challenges:

- **Slow Turnaround on Data Requests:** Business users and managers have to wait days for analysts to generate custom dashboards or ad hoc reports.
- **Missed Opportunities:** By the time sales trends or anomalies are identified, the optimal window for taking corrective action (markdowns, promotions, stock rebalancing) often has passed.
- **Technical Barriers:** Non-technical staff cannot query or explore data beyond prebuilt reports, limiting their ability to ask intuitive, follow-up questions that go beyond what’s already on the dashboard.
- **Fragmented Data Sources:** Important business data is spread across several cloud platforms (Google BigQuery, Salesforce, Excel sheets), making it hard to assemble a holistic view for decision-making.
- **Limited Insight Generation:** Most current tools require users to interpret raw charts and tables themselves—there’s no system that “tells the story” or recommends actions in plain English.

## What the Business Needs

- A **self-service analytics platform** where managers and business staff can use everyday language to explore sales, inventory, and customer data, receiving instant answers, visualizations, and AI-generated recommendations.
- **Automated data integration** from our various sources that keeps the platform’s information up-to-date without manual intervention.
- The ability to quickly uncover trends, root causes behind sales drops or inventory surpluses, and receive suggestions for next steps (e.g., adjust pricing, reallocate inventory, target marketing).
- **Transparency and auditability** for compliance purposes, with logs of what data was queried and what insights were delivered.

## Project Goal

Develop a GenAI-powered data insights portal that enables all business users—not just analysts—to:

- Ask real-time, natural-language questions (e.g., “Why are shoe sales down in Paris stores this quarter?”
- Receive AI-generated narratives, root-cause analyses, and actionable recommendations based on the latest integrated data.
- Visualize insights through dynamically generated charts and summaries, with the ability to drill down or request explanations for observed trends.
- Eliminate dependency on IT or data teams for common business queries, thereby accelerating our operational agility and competitiveness.

## Success Metrics

- **Reduction in average time** from business question to actionable insight (target: from days to minutes).
- **Increased insight adoption**: Percentage of staff regularly generating their own reports/analyses.
- **Operational improvements** driven by timely insights, such as reduced stockouts, improved sales in underperforming regions, or more effective marketing campaigns.
